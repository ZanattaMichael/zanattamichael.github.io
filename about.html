# About Me

Senior Developer @InsyncTechnology

Gday I’m Michael! I’m “That Guy” who loves to ask “Why”? I like to make super cool things in PowerShell dreaming up outrageous ways to do automation.
The more outrageous the better! Battlefield 4 Aimbot in PowerShell? Why Not! Use PowerShell as a backend Webserver? 
I work as a Senior Consultant at Insync Technology within the Identify and Automation team. I am super passionate about PowerShell and love working with people to level up their PowerShell skills. 
I also host the Brisbane PowerShell User group, Stream regularly ongoing projects/ PowerShell lectures on Twitch and contributed to the PowerShell Conference Book.
